- Modern symmetric key algorithms are great! They are fast and secure when implemented correctly and keys are chosen properly.
- Problem: How to get the keys to the two parties?
	- Need a secure channel â€“ a channel that makes it very difficult for the adversary to access the actual plaintext that is being transmitted.
	- But the Internet is not secure!
- **Solution:** Public Key Cryptography

Examples of a secure channel could be a trusted carrier carrying and delivering the key in a locked case or an untapped phone line which the two parties use to agree what the key will be.
