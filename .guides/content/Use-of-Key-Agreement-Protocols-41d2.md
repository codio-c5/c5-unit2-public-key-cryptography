- Users could create random private/public keys each time they communicate

OR

- Users could create private and public keys and publish the public key

Now consider a simple protocol that makes use of the Diffie-Hellman calculation. 

- Suppose that user A wishes to set up a connection with user B and use a secret key to encrypt messages on that connection. 
- User A can generate a one-time private key XA, calculate YA, and send that to user B. 
- User B responds by generating a private value XB, calculating YB, and sending YB to user A. 
- Both users can now calculate the key. 
- The necessary public values q and a would need to be known ahead of time. 
- Alternatively, user A could pick values for q and a and include those in the first message.
