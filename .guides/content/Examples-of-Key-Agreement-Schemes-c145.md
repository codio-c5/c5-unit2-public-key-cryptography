## Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (DH)
- First public key algorithm (1976)
- Developed by Diffie and Hellman and Merkle independently
- Included in the cipher suite for key agreement/exchange in TLS/SSL and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) protocols
## Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (1985)
- Same idea as DH but works on elliptic curves
- Included in the cipher suite for key agreement/exchange in TLS/SSL and Bluetooth (LE) protocols
